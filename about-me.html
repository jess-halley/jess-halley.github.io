              <p> I'm Jess. I'm a social anthropologist by trade, which, broadly speaking, means I study humanity, or what it means to be human within the context of culture. In particular, I'm interested in the ways human beings interact with technologies. Which is why I'm learning to code. My pervious research project focused on the way young refuegee women utilise visual technology and social media to support their experience of resettlement in New Zealand.  Aside from that, in my spear time I am a dedicated nerd. I'm a totally book worm and also podcast obessessed. But my biggest joy in life, is spending quailty time outdoors with my dog George. Although he's part horse, he's a gentle giant. </p>
