        <h2>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?.</h2>
        <p>Over the years I've developed an integral understanding of the things I'm most passionate about in life. As nerdy as it sounds one of these things is research. It's the experience of being on the edge of breaking ground and making new discoveries that I most love. I guess this would be a big component of my higher purpose lens too, the idea of contributing something meaningful to the world.  I have been lucky enough to develop a career in this area. This means my work is really fulfilling and brings me little moments of joy throughout the day.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise what are your core values? </h2>
        <p>The exercise really made me more aware of how much I value hard work. For me, I feel most fulfilled when I'm working hard on a project that is bigger than myself, that will ultimately contribute society in some way.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>What do you stand for? </h2>
        <p>Although I'm most happy when I'm working hard. I understand that this may not be the case for other people. Ultimately I believe people are entitled to find happiness in whatever form it takes for them.</p>
      </div>

        <h2>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h2>
        <p>So far, reading 'Search Inside Yourself', has helped me to catalogue my own thought process. I'm noticing more and more how negative my self-talk is. I hold myself to such a high standard, and I'm really hard on myself when I fall short of my own expectations. Being aware of this mental process, and seeing it as something that is separate from me, has really helped me develop some mental resilience.</p>
