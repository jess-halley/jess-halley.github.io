      <h2>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it? </h2>
      <p>For me, the most interesting component of Meng's 'mindfulness conversation' techniques was the process of 'dipping'. Meng highlights how in regular, everyday conversation we often don't give our full attention to listening to others. This is because it's easy to get distracted by internal feelings and chatter. Meng suggests the best way to respond to this process is to acknowledge this internal chatter, as simply that, internal chatter. When we acknowledge it, it is no longer a distraction. Freeing up your energy to focus on listening to the other person. The key is to acknowledge your internal chatter without judgement. I really liked Meng's analogy of adopting the mindset of a loving grandmother, where instead of judging oneself for internal distractions, you acknowledge these distractions and gently nudge the mind back on track.</p>

      <h2>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice? </h2>
      <p>Life is so busy at the moment it's often hard to find a soild time to practice mindfullness on a daily basis. Like excerise, mindfullness is something that needs to be practiced regularly if we are to experience the full benifits of it. One thing I always make time for is walking my dog. In general, walking George is a big way for me to destress at the end of the day. So I was particularly interested in Meng's techniques for mindfullness walking. I normally listen to podcasts while I'm walking, but I'm going to change that up, and try my hand at some mindfulness walking. </p>
