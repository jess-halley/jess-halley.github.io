      <h2>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h2>
      <p>The rebuild was a challenge for me, it took me awhile to familiarise myself with the skeleton framework. I discovered that my initial wireframe drawings were somewhat ambitious. I struggled to implement these changes without using javascript. I found a way to achieve the design I wanted using javascript, the problem was, I don't yet understand javascript. I had to remind myself about "process over product", and that there was no point in including code that I don't understand in my website. Definitely a learning curve! .</p>

      <h2>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h2>
      <p>Utilising meditation is quickly becoming a strategy for me. I find that when I get stuck with my code, the best thing to do is take a break. This is when I often practice mindfulness, it's always a challenge escaping all the code problems that are running through my mind. But stepping back, and seeing my thoughts from a distance, watching them pass through my mind like balloons, definitely, helps me to relax.</p>

      <h2>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h2>
      <p>Just five minutes a day can make a significant difference.  tiniest amount a day will make a difference. But the science shows you need to do it everyday to reap the benifits </p>

      <h2>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h2>
      <p>Instead of attempting to quiet my mind, I have started accepting my thoughts, as conceptual realities that come and go.</p>
