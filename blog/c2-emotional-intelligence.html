      <h2>Search Inside Yourself - Chapter 1:</h2>
      <p>
        Chapter 1 of Search Inside Yourself has been really rewarding for me. I have practised meditation for a long time and it has always been a struggle for me. This is because I can’t seem to quite my mind. But from what I have learnt about mindfulness through chapter one, is that that goal of mindfulness meditation is not to quite the mind, but become more aware of the mind's activities. Chade-Meng Tan explains that While mindfulness is something we all naturally possess, it’s more readily available to us when we practice on a daily basis. So to do this, I have a daily goal to practice mindfulness for 2 minutes a day. Instead of trying to quiet my mind, I am trying to bring awareness to what I’m directly experiencing via the senses and my state of mind via my thoughts and emotions. Chade-Meng Tan draws on growing research that outlines how in training the brain to be mindful, you’re actually remodelling the physical structure of your brain, through this process, you come to react differently to problems. My typical reaction to any sort of problem is “STRESS, STRESS, STRESS!” so I’m looking forward to reaping the benefits of my mindfulness practice.
