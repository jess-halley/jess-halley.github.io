      A week into phase 0 and what is most interesting is how I've continued to surprise myself. Coming from a social science background, I have no experience working with computer code, what so ever. I was also incredibly nervous to work with code. I envisioned code to be this hard/regimented formula, I figured it would be difficult, and one wrong move could "break" the computer. So I approached my week one tasks with caution. But I have been surprised at how quickly I have learned the commands and been able to problem solve. As each day goes by, I'm getting better and better at talking to my computer and I'm sure we'll be best buds soon.

      I also assumed that I would be the only one in my cohort with no background in computer code. But it's been refreshing to see that people have joined the course from all walks of life, and all of us have a shared interest in learning to code. The online communication with everyone through the slack channel has been particularly helpful, problem-solving together as a team is a really interesting process to be a part of.  Shereef's Fireside Chat, really reflects the type of working culture I have encountered in this first week, particularly his analogy of "all of us being in the kitchen together". I'm hoping that as the weeks go by, I'll come to see myself as a 'legitimate' producer of software, and not just a consumer.
