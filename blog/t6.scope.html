        <h2>What is scope and how does it work in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>I think of scope as a set of premade tools to be utilised for building programs. This is basically, a set of variables, objects, and functions. </p>
        <p>The way these variables are utilised can change depending on their position within the code. So any variables declared within a function are local to that function. This means they only have access to the code within that function, and they can only be accessed from within that function. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, global variables are declared outside of the function. Such variables have a global scope and this means that any algorithms can access them. </p>
