      <h2>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</h2>
      <p>On a daily basis, we use a variety of interfaces to access the internet. Responsive design is important because it allows web content to change to the appropriate screen ratios, of any device. This means that the code will adjust in accordance with screen width. So the content will remain the same, but the layout will look different if you are using a mobile phone, a tablet, or a desktop.</p>

      <h2>Responsive sites are important for a number of reasons:</h2>
      <p>People all over the world utilise a wide variety of interfaces to access the internet. It is important that web content can respond appropriately to each interface.
         It is more efficient and cost effective to utilise responsive frameworks, (such as skeleton) for a single website, then code separate mobile and desktop versions.
         In general, responsive design will increase the number of visitors to a page, as the web content is accessible via any interface.</p>

      <h2>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</h2>
      <p>The mobile phone has quickly become the primary way many people now access the internet. Mobile first design, requires the developer to design web content by considering the mobile user experience first.</p>
      <p>There are a number of benefits to this approach. Scaling down the web experience to suit a mobile interface, can often result in a more lucid and efficient product. This means that further features can then be included in the code to improve the desktop experience.</p>

      <h2>What are frameworks, and what are their pros and cons?</h2>
      <p>A framework is an infrastructure comprising of code. For example, skeleton is a particular framework that assists developers in building a responsive web page. Frameworks can comprise of different languages, CSS HTML and javascript, or instance.  Implementing a framework saves a lot of time, thus helping developers push products out faster. However, a frameworkâ€™s core behaviour can not easily be modified, this means that when developers use frameworks, they are forced to respect its limitation.</p>

      <h2>What is a wireframe and why we use it?</h2>
      <p>A wireframe is essentially a blueprint of a website. It outlines the functional elements and is typically used for planning a site's structure. For developers, wireframes are an opportunity to think about your website from the user's perspective.</p>

                  <h2>Things I found difficult:</h2>
                  <p>The biggest challenge for me was implementing a responsive navigation bar. Every attempt I made mucked up the rows of content I had organised. I also struggled to find a way of coding a responsive nav bar without introducing javascript. Eventually, I figured out a way of doing this using rows, columns, divs and hrefs, all in the right order. But I'm sure this is not the most efficient way to organise my page.</p>
