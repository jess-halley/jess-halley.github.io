        <h2>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h2>
        <p>I'm comfortable with problem-solving, when my code doesn't work I'm able to remain calm and think logically about the next steps. My biggest hurdle is that I constantly think everyone else around me is way more advanced in they're understanding of this stuff then I am. I have this tendency to compare myself to others, it always results in this feeling of inadequacy. It doesn't help that so much good code is available on spaces like Github. When I see beautiful code that is complex in its simplicity I feel as though I'll never be able to produce something to that standard.</p>

        <h2>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h2>
        <p>The most interesting part of the exercise for me was recognising the embodied nature of emotion. I guess I always assumed that I held all of my emotions with my stomach when I'm nervous I get a very strong sense of butterflies in my stomach. But during exercise, I came to see that I also clench my jaw really tightly when I'm anxious when I'm thinking hard about something I also frown! It's really funny that I've probably been doing this my entire life and yet I've never been aware of these habits.</p>
