      <h2>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</h2>
      <p>Self-awareness is a by-product of mindfulness. What was most interesting about this chapter, was how self-confidence can be improved through increased levels of self-awareness. I've struggled with self-confidence for a long time, so this chapter really spoke to me.</p>

      <h2>I tried a practice called 'body scanning'...how did I find it?</h2>
      <p>Body scanning a surreal experience. I've always known that I hold most of my tension in my stomach muscles. But during the meditation, I realised I also tense my jaw when I'm anxious. This is something I wasn't aware of until this practice. Focusing on my body within during meditation, also helped me stay in the mindful zone for longer.</p>

      <h2>What did I take away from the 'My Emotions not me' section?</h2>
      <p>It's easy to be completely mentally overwhelmed by emotions. When this happens we experience our relationship to the world through emotion. This isn't always a helpful way to go through life. The more we do this, the more challenging it can be to detach from difficult situations and gain a clearer perspective. In this chapter, Meng encourages us to gain a level of separation between our mental activity and the chemical emotions we experience. One way to do this is through meditation when emotions arise during mindfulness practices we should take a step back and think aloud 'I'm experiencing anger', etc. This invokes a level of self-awareness and control over our emotional state.</p>
