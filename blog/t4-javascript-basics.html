      <h2>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h2>
      <p>Most web pages we stumble across are built through a combination of structure, style and interactivity.
These jobs are undertaken by 3 different coding languages, HTML, Javascript, and CSS which your browser knows how to interpret.
</p>
<p>HTML should be used only for structuring content.</p>
<p>CSS should be used for applying all visual styles.
</p>
<p>JavaScript should be used for (almost) all interactive
functionality.</p>
<p>Javascript and CSS should be referenced in separate files, never written into HTML.</p>

      <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h2>
      <p>Control Flow Structures are an important aspect of programming languages that allow your code to take certain actions based on a variety of scenarios. Control Flow is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to dictate how your code runs under different conditions or until a certain condition is met. For example, if I were to give a command of "brush your teeth" but there was no toothpaste, we would need and additional command that told the computer "if there is no toothpaste, use floss instead."
      </p>
      <p>A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached, ie stop "continue to floss for 5mins" once 5mins is up the condition would have been reached and the computer will stop.

      <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:</h2>
      <p>
In JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.</p>
      <p>var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
      </p>
      <p>Basically, an array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
      <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>
