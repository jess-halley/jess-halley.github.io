      <h2>Building A House</h2>
A simple way to make sense of the differences between HTML CSS and DOM is to use the analogy of a house:

HTML:
HTML: the structural frameworks, building blocks and blueprints of a website's content.

CSS:
CSS organises the style features of a website. So, drawing on the house analogy, CSS issues the colour of the walls, the room sizes etc.

DOM:
DOM is the wider architectural layout of a website. It manages how everything flows and connects together. I have also heard of the DOM being described as a tree-like structure, whereby different components of a website branch out to other components.

      <h2>Boxifying Design</h2>

"Boxifying" is the process of breaking webpage content down into boxes. Fitting content into boxes is a cleaner way of organising a web page. It is even possible to have boxes within boxes! I gave this a try this week using div, next week I hope to add more boxes to my web page using bootstrap.The Box Model is the basic organising structure of this method. This includes the content, padding, border, and margin.
