        <h2>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h2>
        <p>According to Meng describes compassionate leadership requires the participant to interact with their team through empathy and understanding. My own experiences of this form of leadership come through education.  I've found that the most effective teachers are compassionate toward their students. They are able to empathise with each student and as a consequence, the classroom environment becomes more engaged and productive.</p>

        <h2>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h2>
        <p>In general, I have a tendency to be quite tough on myself. So the goodness meditation is a really good practice for me. Spending a few minutes focusing on myself in a more positive light resulted in this overwhelming sense of relief. Once this occurred I was able to extend this positive light to others, focusing on the good qualities of those around me. I finished the practice feeling lighter in myself.</p>

        <h2>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h2>
        <p>Tonglen is a meditative practice designed to train compassion.  Its primary focus is on the concept of giving and receiving. The tonglen practice provides a more structured route to a compassionate life by working with the breath. The idea is to breathe in suffering and breathe out kindness and compassion. I found the Tonglen practice easier than the goodness mediation. Focusing on my breath is a good way for me to centre myself during meditation. I came away from this practice with the same lighter feeling.</p>

        <h2>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>Understanding the social brain allows us to identify that negative experiences affect us much more strongly than positive ones. Based on studies by psychologist Barbara Fredrickson, this is at a ratio of 3:1. For every negative experience, we require 3 positive ones to balance it out!</p>
        <p>The SCARF model is based on the psychological theory that for every negative experience we require 3 positive experiences of a similar context to counterbalance this. This model outlines five primary categories of our social experience where this theory can be applied.</p>
        <p>My experience of Phase 0 has been a series of ups and downs. It's incredibly exciting to be learning about a new industry, and building programs from scratch. But I have never felt confident with math, and so any of the challenges that involved any level of math stressed me (even though I wasn't actually doing the math, I was asking javascript to do it for me). But it has been really lovely getting to know my fellow hihi cohort, everyone has been so supportive it makes for a really effective learning environment.</p>

        <h2>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h2>
        <p>In a nutshell, Meng argues that the key to difficult conversations is compassion. Difficult conversations occur when people feel that their identity is at risk. I haven't had the opportunity to have a difficult conversation yet, but, when I do I will aim to be conscious of my intentions and impact and remain considerate of the other person's experience.</p>
