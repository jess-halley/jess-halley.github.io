        <h2>Parentheses.</h2>
        <p>Parentheses do many jobs in relation to functions and structures. They can be used to contain the parameters that are passed to functions and to control structures. They may also be utilised to group expressions to control the order of execution. Sometimes functions will have no parameters so in this case, the space between parentheses is left blank.</p>

        <h2>Brackets</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, we use the brackets to store multiple values in a single variable. This is called an Array. An Array is ultimately a list of important data you need the program to remember and retrieve.</p>

        <h2>Braces</h2>
        <p>We use braces in javascript to groups altogether the code blocks or statements. Here its main purpose is to execute several code blocks or statements altogether. Another way we use braces is when we create objects. Here braces are equivalent to the "new Object()" syntax.</p>

        <h2>Single quotes  and Double quotes.</h2>
        <p>Quotation marks are used when defining strings. In JavaScript, there is no meaningful difference between the two. In practice, single quotes are just more convenient.</p>
