    Through my previous experiences doing post-graduate research, I have become familiar with working on my own and managing my own time. But procrastination has long been an issue for me. When I have impending deadlines, I can easily find myself mentally reorganising my priority list. Cleaning out the kitchen cupboard suddenly feels like a matter of significant importance. The way I usually deal with this, is by staunchly putting these feelings aside and forcing myself to focus on the work at hand. This is why the article "The Best Tricks for Getting in the Zone at Work" was of most interest to me. In particular, I found the study about the sweet spot of work between boredom and anxiety to be the most applicable in my own life. This is something I will put into practice going forward.
