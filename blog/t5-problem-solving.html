      <h2>Explain to a non-tech friend about how I got blocked on a simple problem.</h2>
      <p>Learning to code is like learning to speak a new language. This week one of our challenges required us to use JavaScript to generate a visual checkerboard with "#". To solve this problem you need to use a combination of for loops and if-else statements. Giving the "#" a numerical value within the for loop, was where I was going wrong.</p>

      <h2>How I managed to solve a problem in an elegant way?</h2>
      <p>The checkerboard challenge was a real struggle for me, I was blocked for hours. I found that I got the most learning by searching the answer, and rewriting the answer out by hand. In doing so, I would include a summary, in my own words about how each component of the program works. By breaking the answer down in this way, I was able to see the errors in my original program. This strategy has really helped me to gain a more holistic understanding of how JavaScript works.</p>

      <h2>Reflect on how confident I am on using the following problem-solving techniques:</h2>
      <p>Pseudocode: This is the strategy I make use of most. I've found that the best way I learn is to write stuff down. Pseudocode involves writing out both the code and you're own lay understanding of how the program works.
         Even if I don't return to my notes, the act of writing somehow helps me to remember important components of the code.</p>
      <p>Trying something: This week I've realised how flexible JavaScript can be. I'm getting more confident, trying out different solutions to problems. It's been helpful to compare my solution with that of my team parts, this has really highlighted the multiple ways you can problem solve with JavaScript.</p>
      <p>Reading error messages: I'm getting better at reading error messages. Learning more about how to use dev tools has been really helpful for this. </p>
      <p>Console.logging: This is usually the first place I realise there is an error in my code.</p>
      <p>Googling: Google is quickly becoming my best friend. There is wealth a knowledge about how to use JavaScript online, and I've found it really helpful to draw on this.</p>
      <p>Asking your peers for help: It's been so helpful to able to talk to my fellow Hihi team mates when I'm stuck. I learn so much more by problem-solving in a group situation.</p>
      <p>Asking coaches for help: Joesph is awesome! I'm very comfortable asking him for guidance if I'm completely stuck.</p>
      <p>Improving my process with reflection: Writing this blog is really helping with this. I'm forced to regularly reflect on my learning. In general, I find this helps me to remember more going forward.</p>

      <h2>Explain to a non-tech friend what the below functions do.</h2>
      <p>.map()
We use this function within arrays. Array's are lists of important data (otherwise known as elements) we want the computer to remember. The .map() function would call a particular action to an existing array's elements.
</p>
<p>.filter()
.filter() will is a function that will remove any elements from an array which are no longer true once the original function has run.</p>
<p>.reduce()
This method will turn an array into a single value. The value is attributed, based on any operation command you select. The elements of the array are then totalled within this operation and a resulting value is attributed.</p>
